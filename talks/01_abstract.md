# Abstract

Spatial Analysis is a technique for graphing statistical features of binary artifacts for use in obtaining visual information about the structural similarities between the artifacts.  The binary artifacts are typically malware samples, but may be files of any sort.  They are treated as static byte sequences, and the features are fused and graphed onto 2-D grids, with the resulting visualization spatially locating their similarities.  The visualizations are generated using simple sliding windows moving along the byte sequences of a file and calculating statistical features. These features are used to determine matches of highly similar but not necessarily exact byte sequences whose features map them into grid cell regions, indicating “nearness.”  These byte sequences are then used to generate detector algorithms for fast and scalable discovery of family relationships among large artifact collections.  The ability to identify malware family members based on byte sequence similarity could prove invaluable as a quick assessment tool for analysts. We examine the validity of some assumptions Spatial Analysis makes to determine the merit to approach and present our initial findings.
